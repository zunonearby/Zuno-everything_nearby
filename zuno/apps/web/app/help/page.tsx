      {
        question: "Can I place an order directly on this website?",
        answer:
          "No. The public website is designed strictly for local shop discovery, catalog exploration, and checking delivery coverage. To ensure real-time inventory verification and live GPS rider tracking, all orders are placed through the official ZUNO Customer Mobile App.",
      },
      {
        question: "What areas are currently served?",
        answer:
          "ZUNO is actively operational in Renukoot Central (PIN 231217) and adjacent residential colonies in Sonbhadra, Uttar Pradesh. You can test your specific PIN on our Service Area page.",
      },
      {
        question: "How fast is delivery?",
        answer:
          "Because ZUNO operates on a hyperlocal model where delivery partners pick up directly from stores right in your neighborhood, orders typically reach your doorstep within minutes of packaging.",

    category: "Local Shops & Products",
    items: [
      {
        question: "Are products coming from warehouses or local stores?",
        answer:
          "100% of products come directly from verified independent shops, kirana merchants, and local vegetable and fruit vendors located within your town.",
      },
      {
        question: "Are prices higher than buying in person?",
        answer:
          "ZUNO partners with merchants to maintain fair, transparent local pricing without arbitrary platform markups. Prices reflect the shop’s active inventory catalog.",
      },
      {
        question: "What if an item is temporarily out of stock?",
        answer:
          "Before confirming your order in the mobile app, the system checks real-time inventory. In the rare event of a substitution need, the store will contact you before dispatch.",

    category: "Safety & Payments",
    items: [
      {
        question: "What payment methods are supported?",
        answer:
          "The Customer App supports Cash on Delivery (COD), UPI (Google Pay, PhonePe, Paytm), and major online payment cards.",
      },
      {
        question: "How does OTP verification protect my delivery?",
        answer:
          "Every order generated in the Customer App produces a unique 4-digit delivery PIN. The delivery partner cannot mark your order as delivered until you physically provide this code, guaranteeing that handovers cannot be falsified.",
